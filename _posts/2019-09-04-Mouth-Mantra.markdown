_My mouth was sewn up_

Upon waking up from my surgery, The first thing I noticed was how much I didn’t feel. Everything was numb and bloated. Uncomfortable, but not painful. The second thing I noticed was that I could not open my jaw. Strong elastic bands were attached to the surgical hooks on my braces. The only thing that could force my teeth apart was the strong convulsions that came with me vomiting blood all over myself while resting on my hospital bed. My lips were swollen as if my surgeon bundled in a botox injection with my double jaw surgery.

_I have followed a path // That took sacrifices_

This was the promised surgery. The one event that would change my life, solve all my problems. The surgery that five years of braces led up to. After being delayed three times, it was finally done. I always felt uncomfortable with the idea that one expensive medical procedure could fix all of your problems. Life is never that simple. Looking back though, it wasn’t just one medical procedure, it was years of sacrifice. Vacations abandoned for orthodontist appointments. Internships forsaken for delayed surgery dates. So much pain. All leading up to a few hours of surgery, and three months of recovery.

My surgery was successful without any complications whatsoever. They didn’t even have to insert the dreaded catheter. All that was left was to heal. Two weeks in my swelling went down enough to start moving my lips; I could speak. It took effort to make out the words, but I could communicate. The next day, a release show for the project I worked hard on for a year took place. I was in a different state: another sacrifice I had to make for my jaw. Then, as I was about to sleep, I received a message from a friend about how much my work meant to him, and how he wished I was there to see the show. Over a hundred people showed up to that event, and I was not one of them. I wept that night.

_Remove this hindrance_

There’s a reason double jaw surgery is considered a medical procedure and not a cosmetic procedure. The position of my jaw prevented me from breathing easily through my nose, which meant I ended up breathing through my mouth most of the time. This led to an increase in cavities as well as gingivitis. Since my underbite was severe, I couldn’t eat with my front teeth, which meant they wore down faster than my others.

None of those medical issues concerned me. The stain of my underbite was the social anxieties I dealt with because of it. I was a sloppy eater, especially when it came to sandwiches. I hated eating in front of or with other people. It was difficult for me to smile. As if I was permanently in a bad mood, I frowned wherever I went. When it came to talking, I spoke as sloppily as I ate. Words would be mumbled and jumbled together, and occasionally spit and drool would leave my mouth. Worst of all, I felt ugly. I would look in the mirror and see a flesh shoe poking out from underneath my mouth.

For years, I refused to form close relationships with anyone for any reason. I only wanted one thing; that life-changing surgery that was dangling in front of my eyes. My mother would often say; “Once you get your underbite fixed, you won’t be able to stop smiling!” I resented her for saying that.

_I was separated // From what I can do // What I’m capable of_

After nearly three weeks of recovering in Virginia, it was time to go back to Morgantown. I no longer had to eat via a syringe, and the swelling went down enough to make my speech more fluid. I was welcomed by my close friends, who understood me enough to make conversation. It was tiring, but I was able to live in relative normalcy for the next two weeks that my jaw would be closed shut. Unfortunately, the liquid diet I was on eventually proved things difficult. Walking to and from class while barely ingesting a thousand calories meant I was often confined within the walls of my apartment. I would meet with close friends and talk for a while, but it left my jaw sore and my body exhausted for the rest of the day.

One week after moving in, I looked down at my belt and noticed that it was two positions tighter than I usually put it. My weight was dropping, and I couldn’t eat enough to make up for it. I longed for the life I used to live, where I would leave the house in the morning by nine and come back in the night at ten. I missed meeting new people, catching up with my friends, and sitting at the local brewery reading. But this was just another sacrifice; one of the last few.

_Need to break up // Vicious habits_

Three years ago, I grew impatient. I had waited so long for the life-altering event, that it no longer seemed achievable. It had already been delayed once after all. So I decided to take steps and alter my own life. Anyone that would listen, I would speak to. I regularly saw a therapist and started hanging out with a group of people who I considered close friends. And then my surgery was delayed again. My morale was wiped, and I began to assess my progress. I had surrounded myself with the first people willing to be my friend, however, I came to understand that not all friends are good. So I started over, and at the suggestion of someone I casually spoke to at a party, I joined the radio station. And I started making real friends, friends I could depend on.

The years passed, and eventually, I came to realize that the only time people recognized my underbite was when I stuck my finger in between the gap that formed when my jaw was closed. When the next delay came, it didn’t bring as much despair.

_With jaw fallen in // In fallen jaw_

In five days, the elastics holding my jaw together will be removed. I will be able to talk easier, and drink alcohol, but I will still be unable to eat for two weeks more. Six weeks with a closed jaw is a small sacrifice for such a life-changing surgery. Even with my social anxieties, going about my day being unable to speak clearly is worth it. I do wonder though; why did I handle it so well? Why am I so calm? Did my surgery really cause that?

Too many cars on the road, too many people in the streets. Too many bad landlords and musty clubs. Too many deadbeat townies and entitled students. Everyone has an opinion of Morgantown: it’s rusty, it’s dusty. It’s too boring, it’s too wild. It’s hard to pin down what exactly Morgantown is to the diverse set of people that inhabit it. That being said, this town is an intersection, a rest stop, for so many people. Morgantown is never really an intentional destination. You always just “end up” there for one reason or another. How did I end up here, in this small town packed to the brim?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t supposed to go West Virginia University. I feel like that’s a common feeling for people I’ve talked to, though admittedly it’s not a very large sample size. West Virginia isn’t exactly a sexy or well known state outside of sports, and the high acceptance rate and party reputation makes people doubt the quality of education (as if all public universities don’t meet some minimum standard of excellence). Yet here I am, enrolled in the university, for better or for worse. Despite being a pretty poor student in highschool, I aimed high college wise, applying to around eleven in total: six in United States and five in the United Kingdom. Since this was the first major decision I was making in my life, I had this idea that the more schools I applied to the more choices I would have. Little did I know at the time, there was more to choosing a college than simply getting in.
There’s too many people in this fucking town. I’m sure if you’ve ever driven here you’ve said that to yourself at one point or another. Being a town in West Virginia, my sister had this expectation that it was full of white racist southerners  and worried about me living there as a Hispanic man. Thanks to the university however, there is no visible pattern to the people that you might come across. One moment you might be talking to someone with a classic Texan accent; another you might be talking to someone who barely speaks English. I suppose if you’ve ever lived in a large city or even another college town you might have experienced this phenomenon; however, given that Morgantown is a small town in the middle of the Appalachia, it never ceases to surprise me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember the first time I visited Morgantown. And by Morgantown, I really mean the University. It was rainy and humid, much like right now, and nearly every other day in this town. After a long trip from my home in Richmond, Virginia, I was sitting on the tour bus with my parents, seeing the things that the university wanted me to see. Which for the most part meant that we saw very little of the town itself. Instead, as we traveled through the snaking roads and steep hills, we witnessed such riveting sights like Woodburn hall with its signature dusty red bricks and clock tower. Then came the especially modern recreation center that I would spend my future days walking through to get to class. The one destination that really stuck with me was the towers housing complex, where a student shouted loudly: “WVU sucks!” as we walked by. I hadn’t chosen where I was planning on going to school by that point, but I remember thinking to myself something along the lines of: “In some poetically messed up way, I’m gonna end up going to this place.”
There’s too many clubs in this fucking town. Yet somehow I am constantly told that there is nothing to do here. Those people aren’t wrong I guess. In the absence of more interesting things, alcoholism is a very attractive hobby. I’ve given up on counting the amount of active bars and clubs that pop up and close down around the downtown area. On weekend nights, the streets are packed with students and townies alike, looking for a good time in one form or another. For the sports minded, there are tailgates and sports bars to drink at. For the more hip students, frat houses are the main drinking hotspots. I personally choose to drink in the dusty old neighborhoods with the other “alternative” students. For the teetotalers out there, I’m not really sure what else you could do in this town. Or at least, I’ve never cared enough to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrestled a lot with deciding where I was going to go to school. Out of the five United Kingdom universities I applied to, I miraculously was accepted to four (most likely because they didn’t need to see my embarrassingly bad transcript). I had my heart set on Durham University, an ivy league university with an ivy league price tag. The grandiose Norman architecture was enthralling to me, and the strength of its Computer Science program made it a top pick for me. Going to school internationally however, wasn’t something economically feasible considering I was going to be picking up most of the bill myself. I remember acutely the feeling of opening a letter from West Virginia University, knowing in the back of my mind that the scholarship I was offered was too good to pass up. I had a choice to make, and in the end I made the economically responsible one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s too many hills in this fucking town. I’ve never felt the need to visit the gym while living in Morgantown. No matter my destination, there’s always a guarantee that there will be at least two uphill slogs. It’s especially bad if you ever have to get to the downtown center of campus: every incoming path has a hill. You can choose the shortest distance and face the steep set of stairs, or you can choose to approach from the downtown area and face a long, but more gradual slope. I end up walking a lot as a consequence of not owning a car, and I’m sure everyone here that does the same has amazing calves. Morgantown wouldn’t be the same without its characteristic hills. They are a constant reminder of the tiring nature of the this town.
I was exhausted after the six hour drive it took to when I finally moved to Morgantown. Not only because of the journey, but because of all the years I was boxed in those Virginia suburbs. I had always hated living there, and I had an intense desire to get as far away from my hometown as possible. Moving to another country would have accomplished this easily, but I guess settling with Morgantown wasn’t such a bad idea either in retrospect. Morgantown runs antithetical to the suburbs in about every way. For one thing, the suburbs are flat and spralling; so spralling that it’s impossible to get anywhere in a reasonable fashion without a car. In Morgantown, the public transportation situation is quite nice if you’re a student, and the horribly steep hills made everything be built compactly, and thus easy to traverse on foot. There’s also a sense of community missing from the suburbs; rarely do I ever come across a familiar face when going about my day. Morgantown is so central and focused that it’s impossible for me to go about my day without running into someone I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sports never seem to stop in this fucking town. It sometimes feels like I’m the only one that doesn’t seem to care about WVU football. During the spring semester, I only tend to keep track of when the football games start and end, lest I become trapped in the sea of blue and gold wearing the non-standard colors. It’s not like I don’t understand the obsession that people have with sports. It’s an easy thing to get hyped up about, and as I said before: it’s a convenient excuse to drink. Still, being woken up by someone blaring Country Roads at 7am on a Saturday makes me somewhat loathe the sports-fanatical culture. I’m sure if I was a sports fan Morgantown would be heaven for me, but there’s nothing I can really do about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if my first semester in Morgantown is considered abnormal or not. My assigned roommate at Arnold hall dropped out before the semester even started, so I had an entire room to my own self. Having that much space all to myself would have been amazing if Arnold hall was even a little decent, but there was no air conditioning in the entire building so I was mostly just hot for a while. Being away from the suburbs for the first time was a strange experience for me. Living downtown meant that I had access to anywhere I could walk, and I never really felt like I was trapped in my house like I was in the suburbs. This was all too much for young me to process however, and it took me a while to appreciate how lucky I was to be in the heart of Morgantown. I spent most of my time happily locked in my dorm room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s too many homeless people in this fucking town. If you look closely enough, you can see some of the metal anti-homeless spikes that line previously flat pieces of concrete on high street, or the benches with “convenient” arm rests placed in the middle. Every time I see those disgustingly cruel pieces of architecture I visualize a group of men in a room, deciding how much money they are willing to spend to deprive the homeless of a spot to lie down on. I’ve never volunteered at a homeless shelter or anything, much less even acknowledged the existence of a man who “just needed change for the meter,” so I guess I shouldn’t really be claiming moral high ground anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember the day I started to form an appreciation for Morgantown. A friend had recommended me a restaurant in the downtown area, which conveniently was only a short walk away. Slowly making my way down high street, I took note of the many interesting sights: homeless people sitting on the steps of a baptist church, a coca-cola branded mural, and a man blasting his music loud enough for everyone in the entire town to hear. After a short while, I arrived at my destination; a small hole in the wall restaurant on one of the side streets. As I walked in, I was greeted not only by the woman at the counter, but the chef in the back too. In the corner, daytime Japanese television played next a wall that proudly displayed pictures of the menu items. Two entire walls had shelves filled with Japanese books, and the tiny dining space was packed full of happy patrons. While I sat down and ate my meal, one thing stood out to me more than anything else: as customers would leave, the chef would be sure to thank each and every one of them. I wonder how many total times Yama has thanked me considering I manage to eat there almost every other week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s too many familiar faces in this fucking town. It seems like I can’t go anywhere without seeing someone whose existence I must awkwardly acknowledge: the man in a cowboy hat who picks up trash along high street. The baristas at the coffee shop I frequent on a daily basis. The guy I met at a party once who also frequents said coffee shop. You’d think it would be easy to avoid people in a place as big as Morgantown, but if you hang out at the same spots all the time I guess it’s kind of inevitable that you’ll see the same people. I should be more appreciative of those familiar faces, especially the man in the student union who gives me a joyous “have a wonderful day,” as I pass by his office. Due to the nature of Morgantown, there’s too many faces I’ve grown to like that have just disappeared, never to return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have lived in Morgantown for three years now, and I still don’t know if I made the right choice in coming here. In the moment, you could say I made the right choice, but would I have done the same if I knew what I know now? Even with the benefit of retrospect, I’m not too certain. I’ve got nothing but good things to say about the quality of the education at WVU, and the town needs the university just as much as the university needs the town. One thing is certain in my mind: once I leave, I’ll never forget Morgantown and the people who have inhabited it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn’t enough room in this fucking town. Too many familiar faces. Too many good weekends. Too many nice people and their nice small business. Too many conversations struck up by strangers. Too many good places to eat. Too many comfy concert venues. Morgantown is as easy to love as it is to hate, but I didn’t know that going in. Maybe you have your own “Morgantown,” or maybe you’re still waiting for it to show up. Either way, it’s never too late to take some time to look around your own town.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor Perez</name></author><summary type="html">There isn’t enough room in this fucking town.

As usage increases, the urge to increase dosage arises, and addiction settles. This is how addiction works in my mind, though I’m sure the reality doesn’t match up to my own perception. When I think of apathy, I consider it in the same way that I consider my bullshit theory for addiction. Apathy is needed in small doses; you can’t care about everything, to try is a fruitless and maddening task. In the same vein, caring about nothing is as equally as terrible. Apathy breeds sloth and sloth breeds the other ‘a’: atrophy. I of course, say these things with the same ignorant confidence that I present my “addiction theory,” however in my own experiences this is what I’ve found to be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a curious image I’ve found that relates to my experiences with Apathy. It features a skeleton in a running position, with a light blue gradient in the background. At the top, it’s titled with “JUST WALK OUT” with the subtext: “You can leave!!!” To the left of the skeleton, various situations are listed out: “Work, social thing, movies, home, class, dentist, clothes shoppi, too fancy weed store, cops if your quick, friend ships.” Finally at the bottom lies the call phrase: “If it sucks…. Hit da bricks!! - Real winners quit!” My friend Brenn and I have discussed the meaning behind this humorous image at length. Brenn focuses on the ending line, “real winners quit.” His interpretation of the joke is that in western society, there is an expectation that you never give up on anything. For example, dropping out of college is seen as one of the ultimate failures in America, even if it’s the necessary or best course of action. As for myself, I take it in the more literal sense. Fear of missing out is a very real thing, and often times you can find yourself in situations where you aren’t enjoying yourself, but are staying because you feel a sense of obligation. This is especially prominent in some of the friendships I’ve been in where I stay connectected to people because it was simply the easiest course of action, even when those friendships weren’t good for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both of these cases, the decisions are affected by the ultimately meaningless perception that other people will have of us. In order to avoid these sorts of situations, there needs to be a nugget of apathy available to lean on. If people think less of you for doing something that you truly believe needs to be done, that’s their problem. At least, that’s the way I choose to live my life.&lt;/p&gt;

Chances are, if you attend or have attended West Virginia University, you have walked by it. Nestled deep inside the student union, there lies a wall of glass, and on the glass the U92 logo proudly rests. This is the college radio station; the source of Morgantown’s only alternative programming, and more importantly: one of my many homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open the glass door, and you’ll find yourself in a room surrounded by three walls of rusted red brick. Music posters are lined up neatly on the walls, and at the right lies another glass door to a small recording studio, which usually lies empty. If you’re not a staff member, the lady at the desk, Darlene, will probably ask what you need. If you are a staff member however, you’ll probably just walk by her, choosing to saying hello or not depending on how you feel about her presence. Once you get past Darlene, there is an intermediary room that connects to another recording studio. More posters outfit the walls, this time a little less evenly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving onto the next room, you’ll find yourself in the main area of the station. Depending on the time your enter, you’ll find a few people hanging around (usually sports staff). There was a time when DJs took up every available seat, but after the strike, the station lies colder and emptier than usual. The music posters are outta control by this point, and in most spots you can hardly see the wall. Sections of the wall are dedicated to the news staff and sports staff, but the biggest pinboard belongs to the DJ staff. Sign-up sheets for dozens of specialty shows are tacked on. Take a closer look and you’ll find many repeated names: Trevor, Ed, Victor, Kate, and so on. The station has a painfully low amount of DJs, and the ones that are there work tirelessly to keep the airwaves interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this room, you have three different doorways. The most important is completely covered in stickers from various artists and record labels. In the top right, the extremely missable “Studio A” label blends in with all of the visual noise. Enter the doorway and you’ll find yourself in the DJ booth, where the music and transmitters are controlled from. The lighting is dim and colorful, and on the back wall lies a vast shelf packed with CDs that were once in rotation. Across from the shelf, the controls for the station sit next to two seperate record players. Large speakers hang from the ceiling, and in between lies a window to “Studio B”, the place where sports and news staff do their segments. It’s a painfully sterile and boring room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going back to the main room, there lies one more doorway, to the deepest part of the station. The desks of the music, assistant music, and program directors lie there. Poster and sticker wise, it has the highest density of the station. going There is a door to a CD archive that contains pictures of some former and current staff, as well as various musicians titled “The Door of Babes”. Finally there is a hallway that leads to the back entrance, a bathroom, and another vinyl/CD archive.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor Perez</name></author><summary type="html">There is a place, hidden in plain sight.

Much like writing a book, if you just hop on your computer and start typing, you’ll eventually find yourself tangled in your own work, making something that is more or less impossible to work with. If you chose to continue working on the same poor foundation, more and more time will be spent dedicated to solving problems that you caused, that could have easily been prevent. It is because of this that the majority of my time is spent carefully deciphering what the problem is and planning out how I will solve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, a factorial program is one of the earliest programming puzzles you may encounter as a rookie programmer. The first step is understanding what a factorial is and how it behaves. This is the point where I whip out the programmer’s primary tools: pen and paper. Looking at the behavior of a factorial, I would trace it by hand on paper. 3 factorial is 1 x 2 x 3, 5 factorial is 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5, and so on. It’s important to recognize the pattern in this situation: every number is multiplied by every factor before it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I know what a factorial is and how it operates, it’s still not time to leave the paper. The next step is the programmers second best friend: charts! I love charts, can’t get enough of them. It’s easy to get lost when following how a program executes, and charts make things clear. First I label it with the function name factorial(&lt;em&gt;number&lt;/em&gt;) (a function is basically a formula that you write yourself). The &lt;em&gt;number&lt;/em&gt; value can be any number, so the program I write must be able to work with anything. First I look at cases where the program must fail. You can’t take the factorial of a negative number, or a number that doesn’t exist, so I mark that in a box in the top right. After a quick study of my previous findings, I recognize that I should use a special technique that is common for repeatable processes called recursion. Since taking the factorial of any number requires taking the factorial of the previous number before it, I can chain factorial operations based on what number I take in. It’s a little difficult to comprehend at first, but as an example, take 3 factorial and 2 factorial. 3 factorial is 3 x 2 x 1 and 2 factorial is 2 x 1. Another way to calculate 3 factorial is to multiply 2 factorial by 3. Using this logical, every factorial is essential &lt;em&gt;number&lt;/em&gt; x factorial(&lt;em&gt;number&lt;/em&gt;) until &lt;em&gt;number&lt;/em&gt; equals 1. If you can’t exactly follow that, don’t think too hard about it. It’s harder to parse that logic in your mind, which is why a chart is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it’s time to hop on the computer. This should be the easy part. Using whatever language I choose, I take all my notes and write the program. If something goes wrong, I can draw out each step on paper to help understand where I’ve made a mistake. If the solution is completely wrong, I hop off the computer again, and go back to the drawing board. Staring at the screen trying to solve a problem is usually very tiring, and fairly ineffective when it comes to more conceptual problems. Finally, once it’s all said and done, I calculate the factorials of various numbers on paper using a calculator, and input those into the factorial function. If everything checks out, the program is finished.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor Perez</name></author><summary type="html">As I’ve become more and more experienced as a programmer, one thing has abundantly clear: the less time you spend writing code, the better.

Cold enough to require a jacket, and hot enough to sweat in one. As I awoke from my light nap, I felt the thick humidity of the air as my shirt stuck to parts of my chest. Groggily, I went over to the kitchen and started the tea kettle for my evening coffee. It was around six in the evening, and I was following the usual thursday routine: go to class, take a nap, and head over to my college’s radio station to prepare for the five hours of music. This time however, I was adding a step. Nick Flynn was doing a reading in the downtown library, and it just so happened that it fit perfectly into my schedule. The little exposure I had of Flynn’s work impressed me, and there was no real reason not to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking into the downtown library, I asked the girl at the counter for directions to the Milano Reading Room. It had been a long time since I had been in this library, and I could exactly recall where it was. Traversing up the stairs, I felt the memories of the reading room rush in. I had only been there twice before to study, but this time it felt completely different. As I walked up the steps, I could hear light chatter slightly echo the wide chamber. Despite being there before,  I couldn’t help but feel an oppressive sense of grandeur while scanning the reading room. I say “room,” but really that’s a bit of a misnomer. In the moment it felt more like a very wide and tall hall than anything else. Dusty old bookcases lined the walls, broken up by old-looking paintings and busts. Looking right, rows of stiff wooden chairs pointed to an empty podium. Decisively avoiding the sugary refreshments, I took a seat in the back row, quietly acknowledging the english professor that mentioned this event to the class. After a minute or two, Will from that same class sat down next to me, and we had a quick chat before the event started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the reading itself, it had all the key points that you can come to expect from a these sorts of events. The somewhat lengthy and numerous introductions. Light humor mixed in, accompanied by that one guy who loudly chuckles at even the smallest quip. That one dude you’re trying very hard not to look at who had started a bunch of “twitter beef” with your friends a few hours earlier. Flynn was by and large, exactly what I expected. The way he manages to write so many words beautifully while only occasionally making things explicitly clear is what drew me to the event in the first place, and his description of the fire he survived as a child did not disappoint. The poetic prose he writes is enthralling, and hearing him read it aloud put a voice to what I had read the day before. The reading itself was fairly short, clocking in at around thirty minutes long. Walking out with Will, I succumbed to my temptation and picked up a chocolate cookie. Finally, I walked out into the rain to head over to my five hour radio shift.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor Perez</name></author><summary type="html">It was another classic day in Morgantown.

The little exposure I had of Flynn’s work impressed me, and there was no real reason not to go.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/Personal-Blog/water.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Engineering Station</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/Personal-Blog/blog/nonfiction/engineering-station.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Engineering Station" /><published>2018-03-21T00:50:34-04:00</published><updated>2018-03-21T00:50:34-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Personal-Blog/blog/nonfiction/engineering-station</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Personal-Blog/blog/nonfiction/engineering-station.html">&lt;p&gt;It was early October in the very recent year 2017, and I was standing at the PRT station thinking. The thoughts consumed me, sharply dulling all of my senses. Though the thoughts were focusing on a very bad thing, I strangely felt a neutral feeling while I unpacked each and every one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hey, do you remember me?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly I could see. Before me stood a vaguely recognizable figure. After a short moment putting away my thoughts, I pushed out the words: “Aubri, right?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, aren’t you Victor? I remember you from Culturas.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culturas: the student organization for hispanics. It was a name that beckoned the thoughts back.  Again, I paused to put them away. I responded. “How have you been? Haven’t seen you around in a while.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been doing good, haven’t been to the club in a while sadly.” She paused. “Hey, you’re Puerto Rican right?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puerto Rico. The thoughts broke out of the cage again. “Of course, why do you ask?” I knew why she asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How have you been holding up after hurricane Maria? Is your family alright?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s only a few people in my family I haven’t heard from, but they live in the places that didn’t get hit too hard.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I heard the island isn’t getting power back for six months,” said Aubri. Or was it me? The thoughts were screaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, it’s been pretty terrible,” I said. “The island is ruined.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The station lights suddenly flashed the word “BEECHURST”, and it was time for Aubri to leave. “I’m glad you family is at least safe, hope everything ends up okay,” she said before walking away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t recall responding, but I remember thinking about my family. I’ve never had a strong connection to my family, especially the ones that spoke spanish. The language barrier was too strong for me. Yet still, I was worried. Without water, heat stroke was a very real concern. Without power, there was no way to refrigerate my grandmother’s insulin. I was so distant from everything, I heard nothing. The short conversation with my sister I had the day before only fueled my worries. But I couldn’t worry. I had to worry about my studies above all else, and I couldn’t afford to stress about something I could do nothing about. The station lights suddenly flashed the words “WALNUT”, and it was time for me to leave the thoughts behind. Though I haven’t seen Aubri since then, a pleasant thought of her surfaced as I enjoyed my grandmother’s cooking over thanksgiving break. I appreciated it more than I ever have before.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor Perez</name></author><summary type="html">It was early October in the very recent year 2017, and I was standing at the PRT station thinking.

Running from life. Running from family. No matter where I go, I can’t escape. Running from anxiety. Running from reality. Running from my future career. I’ve never been much of an athlete. My legs and my lungs are always in competition of what will give first. Running from my desires, because I felt like I was never worth them. Running from my needs, because other peoples’ were more important. Running is pointless and exhausting. Trying to justify why you’re running is almost as bad as the act of running itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I’ve been running my whole life. I’ve run figuratively from many things. Trying to avoid my problems, hoping they would go away. I’ve also run from things literally. That’s how I ended up in Morgantown, after all. The first time I ran away from home was at the greatest place on earth; Disney World. I was never a very calm child. What I craved most was excitement and thrills. My parents just wanted to take a nice picture in front of the flowers. Pictures ran very antithetical to what I craved as a child. They made me mad, and I loudly rebelled whenever they were taken. “Where are the roller coasters? I wanna ride the roller coasters,” I can imagine myself demanding loudly. Finally, I snapped. We were at a photo studio for all the Disney characters waiting in line to take a picture with Goofy. Can you imagine waiting in line for something that wasn’t a roller coaster? I was having none of that nonsense. My mother said something very poorly thought out in the moment: “If you don’t like it, you can just leave.” So I did. Eight year old me left his family and started wandering around in Epcot, one of the few Disney World parks without roller coasters, to find a roller coaster. Yet, I was a determined little child, and relentless in my unknowingly pointless search. After around thirty minutes of limitless freedom, I saw a horrifying sight: my aunt in a full speed sprint, high heels in hand. I tried running, but it was too late. She tackled me with full force, and started hitting and yelling at me for leaving and worrying my family. I don’t know what felt worse: the fact that all that running had been for nothing, or the high heels.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor Perez</name></author><summary type="html">Running from friends.

As it stands, we as a country are always “pressing the gas” for better or for worse. If you aren’t moving forward, you are a waste of space. You are left behind. You are forgotten. My hometown is not exempt from these suffocating societal bindings. My hometown has never stopped growing and expanding. Every time I come back from a semester of college, another Starbucks has opened up. Commutes take an additional 5 minutes. Housing values rise by a huge factor. The closest grocery store has once again been bought out and remodeled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t like this when I was younger. Or at least I never noticed it. The suburbs are no place for a child, despite the fact that they were constructed for the sole purpose of housing growing families. I spent most of my time in the living room, on the computer. In my peripheral I was comforted by the soft “livings” of my family. My father reading on the couch, or my mother dusting the shelf above the fireplace. In the evening we would all watch the television “together”, as is American tradition. And by watch I mean, the television would be on and playing a show, and everyone would be in the general vicinity, aside from my sister. I would still be on the computer of course, and my father would still be reading, but we would all be passively paying attention to what was going on. Occasional soft chuckles would burst from any one of us, and the ambient noise of keyboard typing and page turning hummed in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That living room now lies cold, even in my presence. My computer was moved to my room. Whatever my father was reading back than was replaced by vapid facebook videos on his tablet. My mother sits on a separate couch. The television still hums in the background, but it’s larger and nicer than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are now 14 Starbucks coffee shops in a five mile radius. The suburbs are no place for a child.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor Perez</name></author><summary type="html">In modern American society, there’s always this notation of forward motion.

I was sitting down with a hot cup of coffee after a day of classes. I’ve done this routine many times before. Sit down, study a bit, maybe get a refill or two, leave. While working on whatever particularly needed to get done that day, a conversation or two might catch my attention. It is a coffee shop after all, and people either sit down to chat or to work. The conversation topics are mostly mundane, but two men caught my attention through the soft music and light mummering of conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh I certainly do have a good life,” said the older man. He was adorned in a tan peacoat and business professional dress, though something about him told me he hadn’t show up to work today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Me too, I’m glad I get to travel,” said the younger man. He seemed in his late thirties, and was very cleanly dressed and groomed. “I visited Piscataway, and I couldn’t even pronounce the name right!” he chuckled. “I was on the phone trying to tell someone where I was and kept saying “Pah-scotch-way”, and finally they figured it out- I was talking about Piscataway!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They both chuckled quietly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You know I actually went to grad school around there”, said the older man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I know where you’re talking about, my cousin might have went there too. How was that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, I never talked to the undergrads there, but I tell you- I always used to hang around the davis library. All of the girls hung around there!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another quiet chuckle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“New Jersey is a weird place. I was at lowes once and the cashier was around 17 years old. He kept saying to me as he checked me out, he said to me “beg?””. The young man paused reflectively. “I was very confused, and he kept saying “beg” to me until he finally pointed to bags and I was like “Ohhhhh, bag!””&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chuckling was out of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t really speak New Jersian.”, stated the young man rather obviously. It was clear the conversation had long since died before I started listening. “Well I’m gonna havta get going now, we should chat again sometime.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well I’m not going to be around here to long. I’m down here for the open mic night, but I dunno how long I’ll be around town”.The younger man seemed a little disappointed at this revelation. “I’m pretty easy to find though, if you want to chat while I’m around.” the old man was far too nice for his own good.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor Perez</name></author><summary type="html">It was the late afternoon, a Tuesday if I recall.

What it lacks in substance it makes up for with the very visceral senses and feelings. It’s an insignificant memory, mundane even. I am very young, living in the countryside of northern New York. The aroma of sawdust filled the room prominently, for reasons that are unknown and quite frankly not relevant. Lying down on my bed next to the sunny window, I have a book in hand. With the only source of light in the room being the window, I lean in, lazily reading a novel while a subtle, but relentless pounding fills my head. The pounding is restrictive, and only highlights my unfortunate situation: I am trapped in this room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feeling of being trapped is not a unique one. Whether it be literal or metaphorical, being trapped has constantly crept up again and again in my life. It brings out a very primal sort of panic in me, akin to drowning. As much as I fight, the fact that there is no escape doesn’t change. The only escape comes from what I choose to distract myself with. Rolling around in my bed, the book was my ward of choice for this occasion. Suddenly, the slow creaking of a door resonates throughout the room. Almost instinctively, I ensure the book is hidden from sight and freeze. Despite being so young, I am not naive enough to think my mother is fooled by this move. After all, my earlier protest was very vocal and passionate. I always hated napping.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor Perez</name></author><summary type="html">The memory is faint, and very old.

      <p><strong><em>the following piece is a work from early on in my writing career. It remains largely unedited (since the published date), and largely not fact checked. Published date is an approximation</em></strong></p>

<p>The newest album from Animal Collective, Centipede Hz manages to make a unique album, without from the smooth psychedelic rock feel that Animal Collective is known for.
<!--more-->
Now, most people will scream and yell at me for this, but I actually think this is the best album Animal Collective has ever released <em>Ducks</em>. I’ll try not to make too many comparative statements, but compared to Merriweather Post Pavilion Centipede Hz is more fun to listen to in the long run. I still love Merriweather Post Pavilion, but to me it seems like it’s way to smoothed and polished. Polish is good and all; but when I’m listening to an album, I want to hear things that are unique and new to music. Centipede Hz seems to fill in the hole of desire that was created from listening to a lot of samey rock. I was filled with the desire to listen to something new and different that raises the bar that Animal collective set. With a strong opening song like <em>Moonjock</em> and <em>Today’s Supernatural</em>, I was completely turned on from the beginning of listening. While maybe strange, (Just watch the Today’s Supernatural music video), what were you really expecting? It’s Animal Collective! Psychedelic and trippy rock! <em>New Town Burnout</em> seems to strengthen the album’s status as “Best Animal Collective album”, with strong instrumentals and vocals.</p>

<p>Although I have heard claims that Centipede Hz is “Too unpolished for Animal Collective” or complaints such as “The extraneous sounds cover up uncreative instrumentals and repetitive rhythms”, (Which are very one-sided and unintelligent claims), from an average listeners point of view; this album is the pinnacle of Animal Collective’s musical discography. Maybe not 2012’s #1 album, (Beach House secured that with <em>Bloom</em>), it definitely secured a spot in my top ten list.</p>

<p><strong>8.5/10</strong></p>
